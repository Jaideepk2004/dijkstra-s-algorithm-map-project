# dijkstra-s-algorithm-map-project
A website offering Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm Map can provide an interactive platform to visualize the algorithm's process in finding the shortest path between two points on a map. It can demonstrate step-by-step exploration, highlight optimal routes, and allow users to input custom data, making complex pathfinding concepts easy to understand.
